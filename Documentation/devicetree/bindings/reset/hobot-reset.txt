Hisilicon System Reset Controller
======================================

Please also refer to reset.txt in this directory for common reset
controller binding usage.

The reset controller registers are part of the system-ctl block on hobot SoC.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be
		 "hobot,x2-reset"
- #reset-cells : Specifies the number of cells needed to encode a
  reset source.  The type shall be a <u32> and the value shall be 2.

	 Cell #1 : offset of the reset assert control
	           register from the syscon register base
	 Cell #2 : bit position of the reset in the reset control register

Example:
	rst: reset-controller {
		compatible = "hobot,x2-reset";
		#reset-cells = <2>;
	};

Specifying reset lines connected to IP modules
==============================================
example:

        ips: ips@..... {
                ...
		resets = <&rst 0x40 2>; /* offset: 0x40; bit: 2 */
                ...
        };
